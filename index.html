      <h3>Latest Project</h3>
      <p> I created an app called Job Seeker which connects employers and employees online ,according to job wanted by the employee and the type of candidates required by the employer .This helps people from rural areas to market by just uplaoding their CVs on their accounts and waiting for notifications for job match.Only thing will be left is interviews.</p>
